# 01-PyBank

* In this challenge, we were tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a hypothetical company. The financial data was loaded from a csv called [budget_data.csv]. The dataset was composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.

* The Python script in main.py analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script both prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
